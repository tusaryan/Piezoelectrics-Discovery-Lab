## 📖 Overview

This project leverages **Materials Informatics** and **Machine Learning** to accelerate the discovery of high-performance, lead-free piezoelectric materials.

By training advanced regression models on chemical composition data, this application provides a "Virtual Laboratory" that can predict critical material properties—specifically the **Piezoelectric Coefficient ($d_{33}$)** and **Curie Temperature ($T_c$)**—**in seconds, replacing months of traditional trial-and-error experimentation.**

## 🌍 The Problem: The "Lead Dilemma"

For decades, **Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT)** has been the industry standard for piezoelectric devices (sensors, actuators, ultrasound) due to its exceptional performance. However, PZT creates a significant global challenge:

* **Toxicity:** PZT contains over 60% lead by weight, a neurotoxin that poses severe health risks.
* **Environmental Impact:** E-waste containing PZT leaches lead into soil and groundwater, causing long-term contamination.
* **Regulatory Pressure:** Global directives like **RoHS** are restricting the use of hazardous substances, creating an urgent need for eco-friendly alternatives.

Finding a lead-free replacement is difficult because the search space of possible chemical combinations is vast. Traditional "cook and look" methods are too slow and expensive to explore this space effectively.

## 💡 The Solution

This project implements a **Data-Driven Workflow** to bypass traditional limitations:

1.  **Data Collection:** Aggregated data on lead-free ceramics (specifically KNN-based) from scientific literature.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** Developed a robust chemical parser to convert complex chemical formulas (including solid solutions and dopants) into numerical features.
3.  **Predictive Modeling:** Trained and compared multiple ensemble learning algorithms (XGBoost, Random Forest, LightGBM) to accurately predict material properties.
4.  **Web Application:** Wrapped the ML engine in a modern Full-Stack application, allowing researchers to easily test new compositions and retrain models with new data.

## 🚀 Features

### 1. 🧪 Interactive Property Prediction
* **Smart Parsing:** Handles complex stoichiometry, solid solutions (e.g., `0.96(KNN)-0.04(BNT)`), and dopants.
* **Dual-Target Prediction:** Simultaneously predicts:
    * **$d_{33}$:** Piezoelectric charge coefficient (pC/N).
    * **$T_c$:** Curie Temperature (°C).
* **Formula Builder:** A GUI-based tool to construct valid chemical formulas without typing errors.

### 2. 📊 Automated Model Training & Fine-Tuning
* **Dynamic Retraining:** Upload new datasets (`.csv`) directly via the UI to retrain the models.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Adjust `n_estimators`, `learning_rate`, and `max_depth` via simple sliders.
* **Real-time Visualization:** Instantly generates Research-Grade plots to validate the new model:
    * **Comparison Bar Charts:** Compares $R^2$ and RMSE across multiple algorithms.
    * **Regression Scatter Plots:** Visualizes "Predicted vs. Experimental" values with ideal fit lines.

### 3. 💾 Model Management
* **Production Deployment:** "One-click" deployment of the best-performing model to the production environment.
* **Consistency:** Ensures the exact parsing logic used during training is applied during prediction.

## 🔬 Scientific Validation

To ensure reliability, the model evaluates multiple algorithms before selection. This mirrors the methodology found in recent literature:

* **Algorithms Tested:** Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, Gradient Boosting, SVR.
* **Metrics:** $R^2$ (Coefficient of Determination) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).
* **Validation:** Uses an 80/20 Train-Test split to prevent overfitting.

*Example Visualization generated by the app:*
> The system automatically plots predicted values against experimental values to visually confirm the model's accuracy on unseen data.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

This project lays the groundwork for a complete autonomous discovery system. Future expansions include:

1.  **Inverse Design (Genetic Algorithms):**
    * Instead of just predicting properties for *known* formulas, use a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to *generate* new, hypothetical compositions and evolve them to maximize $d_{33}$ and $T_c$.
2.  **Deep Learning Integration:**
    * Implement Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to better capture crystal structure relationships.
3.  **Microstructure Analysis:**
    * Integrate Computer Vision (CNNs) to analyze SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) images and correlate microstructure with piezoelectric performance.
4.  **Expanded Property Prediction:**
    * Add models for Dielectric Loss ($\tan \delta$), Planar Coupling ($k_p$), and Density ($\rho$).
